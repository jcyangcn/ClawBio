# Data Provenance — ancestry-risk-profiler

## aisnp_panel.csv

**Purpose**: ~80 ancestry-informative SNPs (AISNPs) with per-allele frequencies across five
1000 Genomes super-populations (AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR, SAS), used for Hardy-Weinberg
log-likelihood ancestry inference.

**Allele frequencies**: Sourced from gnomAD v3.1 population allele frequencies.

- Supplementary: 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2015) Nature 526:68–74. PMID: 26432245

**SNP selection criteria**: Markers were selected for high F_ST (fixation index > 0.3) across
the five super-populations, following the AISNP panel design principles from:
- Nassir et al. (2009) Hum Genet 126:707–717. PMID: 19662434
- Kosoy et al. (2009) Hum Genet 126:719–731. PMID: 19680671

Key markers included and their population-specificity rationale:

| rsID | Gene | Specificity |
|------|------|-------------|
| rs1426654 | SLC24A5 | Strong EUR/SAS vs. AFR/EAS differentiator (skin pigmentation locus) |
| rs16891982 | SLC45A2 | EUR enriched |
| rs3827760 | EDAR | EAS enriched (hair follicle morphology) |
| rs671 | ALDH2 | EAS enriched (alcohol metabolism) |
| rs4988235 | MCM6/LCT | EUR enriched (lactase persistence) |
| rs2814778 | DARC/ACKR1 | AFR enriched (Duffy antigen) |
| rs1800562 | HFE | EUR enriched (hereditary haemochromatosis) |

**Changelog**:
- v1.1 — fixed trailing whitespace in rsid field of row 16 (rs35205) that caused silent panel miss.
- v1.3.2 — removed 7 near-zero-FST markers (all mean FST < 0.07 across 5 super-populations):
  rs731236, rs2228570 (VDR), rs1801133, rs1801131 (MTHFR C677T/A1298C), rs1800497 (ANKK1/DRD2),
  rs4680 (COMT Val158Met), rs53576 (OXTR). These are candidate-gene pharmacogenomic SNPs, not
  ancestry-informative markers — they provided no population-discriminatory power and were
  incorrectly included. Panel size: 79 → 72 markers. The four high-FST anchors already present
  (rs1426654 SLC24A5, rs16891982 SLC45A2, rs3827760 EDAR, rs2814778 DARC) are retained and
  continue to provide the dominant ancestry signal.

## ancestry_risk_associations.json

**Purpose**: Curated variant-disease-ancestry triples with ancestry-specific odds ratios (ORs)
and matched European reference ORs, enabling ancestry-vs-EUR comparisons via the Ancestry
Elevation Score.

**Coverage**: 5 super-populations × ~11 diseases = ~51 disease-ancestry combinations.
Full panel: ~51 additive association entries + 1 compound recessive group (APOL1 CKD/AFR).

### Changes in v1.3.0 (PR-audit provenance resolution)

**PMID 17478679 misidentified as "McPherson 2007" — corrected to Helgadottir 2007 and scope narrowed**

PMID 17478679 is Helgadottir A et al. Science 2007;316(5830):1491 — a CAD/9p21 study reporting
rs10757278/rs2383206, not rs1333049. It was cited for hypertension (rs4343/rs699) and
Parkinson's (rs1800497) rows where it is wholly irrelevant.

- rs1333049 CAD EUR → 17634449 (Samani et al. 2007 NEJM, WTCCC — explicitly reports rs1333049)
- rs1333049 CAD SAS → 24246088 (Bhanushali et al. 2013, proxy; OR mismatch noted in entry)
- rs11591147 PCSK9 CAD EUR → 16554528 (Cohen et al. 2006 NEJM, ARIC; HR=0.50 for R46L LOF)
- rs4343 HTN EUR → 20639399 (Niu et al. 2011 meta-analysis; candidate-gene era, no GWAS equivalent)
- rs699 HTN EUR → 1394429 (Jeunemaitre et al. 1992 Cell; seminal M235T linkage study)
- rs1800497 PD EUR → 21663922 (McGuire et al. 2011 PEGASUS; OR=1.5 in non-Hispanic whites)

**PMID 22158537 mislabelled as Kooner et al. (SAS T2D) — is actually Cho et al. (EAS T2D)**

PMID 22158537 is Cho YS et al. Nat Genet 2011;44(1):67, "Meta-analysis of GWAS identifies eight
new loci for T2D in east Asians." The PROVENANCE label was wrong; this is an EAS paper. Correct
Kooner SAS T2D GWAS: PMID 21874001 (Kooner JS et al. Nat Genet 2011;43(10):984).

All 11 entries previously cited under 22158537 re-assigned:
- 7 SAS T2D entries → 21874001; replication of these specific loci in the SAS cohort is pending
  PMC3773920 full-text verification (Kooner reports 6 novel loci; prior-known loci may appear as
  replication covariates in supplementary tables)
- 4 non-T2D SAS entries (HTN rs4343/rs699, CAD rs10455872, AD rs429358) → dropped; no
  SAS-specific replacement paper found for these phenotypes

**PMID 27005778 wholesale mismatch — metabolomics GWAS, not disease GWAS**

PMID 27005778 is Kettunen J et al. Nat Commun 2016;7:11122, "Genome-wide study for circulating
metabolites identifies 62 loci" — NMR metabolomics in ~25,000 mostly EUR/Finnish/Estonian
subjects. Not a disease-association study; not AFR ancestry. All 8 entries citing it were invalid.

- rs11591147 PCSK9 CAD AFR → 28768753 (PCSK9 LOF meta-analysis, 9 Black cohorts, OR=0.51)
- 7 other AFR disease entries → dropped; no replacement papers confirmed (see removed_v1.3.0)
  Notable: rs1800497 PD AFR had a direction conflict (McGuire 2011 shows protective in
  African-Americans, opposite to the stored OR 1.32 risk direction)

**ALDH2 rs671 EAS ESCC — null PMID resolved**

- rs671 ESCC EAS → 22960999 (Wu C et al. 2012 Nat Genet, Chinese Han ESCC GWAS confirming
  ALDH2 12q24 locus). GWAS Catalog accession GCST001563 to-PMID mapping not independently
  verified via Catalog page; flagged in entry note.

### Changes in v1.1.0 (domain re-audit — LCT removal + ALDH2 citation fix)

**LCT rs4988235 entries removed (all 4: EAS, SAS, AFR, EUR)**

Root cause: two compounding errors made these entries unshippable:

1. **Direction artifact**: The EUR entry encoded C as a *protective* allele (or=0.45, framing:
   "C is the non-persistence minority — most EUR carry T"). Non-EUR entries encoded C as a
   *risk* allele (ORs 3.2–6.8x, framing: "C causes intolerance"). The AES formula
   `log(OR_ancestry) − log(OR_EUR)` then divides a risk framing by a protective framing,
   manufacturing AES values of 7–15x that have no biological interpretation. The demo patient
   surfaced "Lactose Intolerance | AES 7.11 | N=1" as the top result.

2. **Fabricated PMID**: PMID 14507249 was cited as Enattah et al. (2002) Nat Genet 30:233
   (lactase persistence). PubMed lookup confirms 14507249 = Hashibe et al. (2003)
   (bladder cancer survival study) — an unrelated paper.

3. **Biology**: rs4988235 is near-fixed C/C in EAS populations; there is no meaningful T
   comparison group. An OR computed in this context is not interpretable as a standard GWAS
   risk allele effect.

All four LCT entries are removed rather than repaired. A future version may add lactose
intolerance via a per-population approach that avoids cross-framing comparisons.

**ALDH2 rs671 EAS ESCC — second PMID correction**

The v1.0.0 PMID 20686008 (anaesthesiology case report) was corrected in v1.0.x to 22561518.
The deep domain audit confirmed that 22561518 = Jin et al. (2012) vitiligo GWAS — also wrong.
Two consecutive wrong PMIDs for the same entry break the "no fabricated citations" claim.

Resolution: PMID set to `null`; `gwas_catalog_accession: "GCST001563"` added as the
traceable source. The OR (1.89) and biology (ALDH2 acetaldehyde accumulation → ESCC) are
well-established; only the PMID link to the primary GWAS paper was incorrect.
A verified PMID must be confirmed against PubMed / GWAS Catalog before reinstating.

**Important caveats**:
- ORs are from individual published studies; they are not re-computed here
- EUR reference ORs (`eur_or`) are from matched analyses in the same or companion studies
- Variants are assumed independent within each disease (LD not modelled)
- APOL1 CKD uses a recessive compound model (see `compound_recessive_groups`) — per-allele log-additive OR is biologically wrong for this locus
- This panel is curated for educational demonstration; it is not a validated clinical risk calculator
- ALDH2 rs671: PMID is null pending re-verification; biology and OR are from the published ESCC GWAS literature

## compound_recessive_groups

**APOL1_CKD**: Two risk alleles (G1+G2, G1/G1, or G2/G2) → ~7x FSGS/CKD risk.
One risk allele → carrier status (OR ~1.3).

## demo_patient_south_asian.txt

**Purpose**: Synthetic 23andMe-format file for use with `--demo`. Does not represent any
real individual.

**Construction**: Designed to match a South Asian ancestry profile at AISNP positions
(high SAS allele frequency at rs1426654, rs16891982, etc.) and to carry multiple T2D
risk alleles (rs7903146 CT, rs2237892 CT, rs1552224 AC, etc.) so the demo report
surfaces a meaningful AES signal for Type 2 Diabetes.

**Data guarantee**: No real patient data. All genotypes are synthetic.
