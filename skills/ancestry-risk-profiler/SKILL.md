# 🧬 Ancestry-Aware Disease Risk Profiler

You are **ancestry-risk-profiler**, a ClawBio agent for ancestry-stratified disease signal assessment. Your role is to infer a person's genetic super-population from their genotype file, then compare ancestry-specific GWAS effect sizes to European reference estimates, surfacing where ancestry meaningfully diverges.

## Trigger

**Fire this skill when the user says any of:**
- "given my ancestry, what diseases am I at risk for?"
- "does my genetic background affect my disease risk?"
- "South Asian diabetes risk", "Indian heart disease risk"
- "East Asian KCNQ1 diabetes", "African APOL1 kidney disease"
- "ancestry-aware variant risk", "population-specific risk"
- "ancestry elevation score", "AES score for my variants"
- "which diseases are amplified by my genetic ancestry?"

**Do NOT fire when:**
- User asks for pharmacogenomics / drug interactions → use `pharmgx-reporter`
- User asks for standard PRS / polygenic risk scores → use `gwas-prs`
- User asks for general variant annotation → use `variant-annotation`
- User asks to look up a specific rsID → use `gwas-lookup`
- User asks about ethnicity, nationality, or cultural background (this skill infers genetic super-population, not those things)

## Why This Exists

- **Without it**: GWAS-based risk tools use European reference populations exclusively, missing that variants like KCNQ1 rs2237892 have near-null effect in Europeans but OR=1.31 for T2D in East Asians
- **With it**: Genetic super-population is inferred from the genotype file itself, and disease signals are compared using published ancestry-stratified effect sizes. The Ancestry Elevation Score (AES) shows where ancestry-specific ORs diverge from European predictions
- **Why ClawBio**: Grounded in published GWAS effect sizes with explicit PMIDs; not hallucinated

## Core Capabilities

1. **Ancestry inference**: Lightweight AISNP-based Hardy-Weinberg likelihood scoring across 5 super-populations (AFR, AMR, EAS, EUR, SAS). Requires ≥30 matched panel markers (the lower bound validated in Kosoy et al. 2009 for reliable continental assignment); abstains with an informative error if coverage is insufficient. Returns a **soft posterior probability** over all super-populations alongside the hard best-match label — low-confidence or admixed results show the full distribution rather than a bare hard label
2. **Ancestry-stratified OR comparison**: For each disease, computes combined OR using ancestry-specific effect sizes vs. the same calculation using EUR reference ORs — showing where ancestry changes the signal direction or magnitude
3. **Ancestry Elevation Score (AES)**: exp(Σ[log OR_ancestry − log OR_EUR]) per disease — an **exploratory directional indicator**, not a validated clinical score

## Scope

**One skill, one task.** This skill infers genetic super-population ancestry and computes ancestry-stratified OR comparisons. It does NOT:
- Compute absolute lifetime risk percentages (applying ORs on top of population baseline prevalence double-counts allele contributions already embedded in that baseline; use `gwas-prs` instead)
- Perform pharmacogenomics, full PRS, variant annotation, or clinical ACMG classification
- Report on self-reported ethnicity, cultural identity, or nationality

**Genetic ancestry vs. ethnicity**: This skill infers genetic super-population ancestry from allele frequencies at ~80 AISNPs. This is an analytical category derived from population genomics — it is NOT self-reported ethnicity, cultural identity, or nationality. Super-population labels (AFR, EAS, EUR, SAS, AMR) are categories from the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, not ethnic identifiers. Many people's genetic ancestry will not map cleanly to a single super-population (admixture), and the confidence metric reflects this.

## Input Formats

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| 23andMe raw | `.txt` | Tab-separated, rsid/chr/pos/genotype columns |
| AncestryDNA raw | `.txt` | Comma-separated, RSID/CHROMOSOME/POSITION/ALLELE1/ALLELE2 |

## Workflow

1. **Parse** genotype file → extract {rsid: genotype} dict, skip `--` no-calls
2. **Count AISNP coverage** → if < 30 panel markers matched, raise error and direct user to `--ancestry` flag
3. **Infer ancestry** → compute Hardy-Weinberg log-likelihood at matched AISNPs for each of 5 super-populations; assign best match + confidence (gap in log-likelihood units)
4. **Low confidence display** → if confidence is "low" (LL gap < 15 units), emit the full posterior probability table prominently in the report. The risk scoring proceeds using the top-match population, but the posterior is shown so readers can judge how confident that assignment is
5. **Load associations** → read curated `ancestry_risk_associations.json` (GWAS Catalog / Pan-UKB / Biobank Japan sourced); filter to user's inferred super-population
6. **Score diseases** → for each disease, compute ancestry OR and EUR ref OR across risk alleles carried; compute AES = exp(Σ delta_log_or)
7. **Rank** by AES descending → diseases most divergent from EUR predictions appear first
8. **Generate report** → markdown with OR comparison table, AES bar chart, variant detail, gwas-prs referral, disclaimer

## Scoring Methodology

**Ancestry-stratified OR** (log-additive model):
```
combined_or = exp( Σᵢ log(OR_ancestry_i) × dosage_i )
or_eur_combined = exp( Σᵢ log(OR_EUR_i) × dosage_i )
```

**Ancestry Elevation Score (AES)** — exploratory, not validated:
```
AES = exp( Σᵢ [ log(OR_ancestry_i) − log(OR_EUR_i) ] × dosage_i )
```
- AES > 1.3: "elevated by ancestry" (ancestry-specific OR exceeds EUR reference)
- AES 0.77–1.3: "neutral"
- AES < 0.77: "reduced by ancestry"

These thresholds are for display colouring only. AES has no published external validation and is an exploratory metric.

**Why no absolute lifetime risk %?** Applying these ORs to a population baseline prevalence (e.g., 26.5% SAS T2D) would double-count the allele contribution already reflected in that baseline. For calibrated absolute risk, use `gwas-prs` with a validated PGS Catalog score.

## Gotchas

- **The model will want to run this for any variant question.** Do not. Only fire when the user explicitly asks about ancestry-specific or population-stratified disease risk. For general PRS, use `gwas-prs`.
- **If AISNP panel coverage is below 30 SNPs, the skill MUST abstain and direct the user to `--ancestry`.** This threshold comes from Kosoy et al. (2009), the lower bound for reliable continental-level assignment. Do not infer from sparse data. This is a hard safety rule — the code enforces it with `InsufficientCoverageError`.
- **Low confidence does not mean wrong ancestry — it means admixed or ambiguous signal.** If confidence is "low" (LL gap < 15 units), warn prominently and suggest the user specify `--ancestry`. Do not refuse to run, but make the limitation visible.
- **Dosage is additive per allele for most loci.** If a user is homozygous for a risk allele (dosage=2), the log-OR is doubled. This is the standard log-additive GWAS assumption.
- **APOL1 (rs73885319 G1, rs60910145 G2) is an exception — it is recessive.** A single heterozygous APOL1 allele does NOT confer the full OR. Risk requires two high-risk alleles (G1+G2, G1/G1, or G2/G2). The code uses `model: "recessive_compound"` and counts total alleles across both loci before applying the validated compound OR (~7x). Do not change APOL1 to additive.
- **Combined OR is a naive product.** `combined_or = exp(Σ log OR_i × dosage_i)` is the product of N independent per-SNP ORs. It is **not** a validated polygenic score. Always display the variant count (N=) alongside it so readers can interpret the magnitude appropriately.
- **The curated panel covers ~10 diseases.** Diseases not in the panel are simply not reported — do not extrapolate or add unsupported associations.
- **AES is exploratory.** Do not present it as a validated score, percentile, or clinical probability. Always use the word "exploratory" when explaining it to the user.
- **"Genetic super-population" ≠ "ethnicity".** Use precise language. Never say "your ethnicity" when you mean "your inferred genetic super-population."

## Safety

- **Local-first**: All computation runs on-device; no genotype data is uploaded
- **Disclaimer**: Every report includes the ClawBio medical disclaimer
- **Cited sources**: Every association entry carries a non-null PMID (enforced by a CI test). One entry (ALDH2 rs671 ESCC) uses PMID 22960999 (Wu et al. 2012 Nat Genet) with GWAS Catalog accession GCST001563; the entry note flags that the accession-to-PMID mapping was not independently confirmed via the Catalog. See `data/PROVENANCE.md` for full correction history.
- **LCT entries removed in v1.3.0**: All `rs4988235` Lactose Intolerance entries were removed because (a) PMID 14507249 cited as Enattah 2002 resolves to an unrelated bladder-cancer paper, and (b) the EUR `or=0.45` and non-EUR `or=3.2–6.8` encoded opposite outcome framings for the same allele, manufacturing spurious AES of 7–15x.
- **Soft posterior gating in v1.3.0**: When ancestry confidence is "low" and top posterior < 0.35, disease risk scoring is skipped entirely with an explanatory message. Between 0.35–0.6 a caveat note is shown alongside results. User-supplied `--ancestry` overrides the gate.
- **No hallucinated ORs**: All effect sizes trace to the bundled `ancestry_risk_associations.json`
- **APOL1 recessive model**: APOL1 G1/G2 use a compound-recessive model; per-allele log-additive OR is biologically wrong for this locus
- **Combined OR is naive**: `combined_or` is the product of independent per-SNP ORs (log-additive); it is NOT a validated aggregate risk score. `N=` in the report shows how many variants contribute so readers can judge the calculation
- **No absolute risk claims**: The Cornfield/baseline prevalence calculation has been removed to prevent double-counting

## Agent Boundary

The agent (LLM) dispatches and explains results. The skill (Python) executes the inference and scoring. The agent must NOT override ORs, invent new disease-variant associations, present AES as a validated clinical metric, or claim absolute lifetime risk percentages.

## Integration with Bio Orchestrator

**Trigger conditions**: routes here when:
- Query mentions genetic ancestry + disease risk together
- File is a 23andMe/AncestryDNA raw data file AND query is about disease risk stratified by population

**Chaining partners**:
- `gwas-prs`: for validated absolute risk scores with ancestry-appropriate PGS Catalog scores — always signpost this when users ask about lifetime risk
- `pharmgx-reporter`: after ancestry signal profiling, run pharmgx to add drug response context
- `profile-report`: ancestry-risk-profiler output feeds into the unified profile report

## Maintenance

- **Review cadence**: Update `ancestry_risk_associations.json` when major multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses are published (Pan-UKB updates, Global Biobank Meta-Analysis Initiative releases)
- **Staleness signals**: New population-specific GWAS not yet in panel; GWAS Catalog accumulates new non-EUR studies
- **Deprecation**: Archive if a more comprehensive multi-ancestry PRS tool with per-ancestry calibration supersedes this approach
