"""Cross-platform text writing for reproducibility bundles.

Every text artifact in a reproducibility bundle (commands.sh, params.yaml,
provenance JSONs, environment.yml, checksums, configs) must be byte-identical
regardless of the OS that generated it. Python's ``Path.write_text`` /
``open("w")`` use ``newline=None`` by default, which translates ``\\n`` to
``os.linesep`` — emitting CRLF on Windows. CRLF then:

  * breaks ``commands.sh`` (a ``\\r`` leaks into shell variables / line
    continuations under bash),
  * changes every file's sha256 (so ``manifest.json`` checksums differ between
    a macOS/Linux-generated bundle and a Windows-generated one),
  * makes ``sha256sum -c checksums.sha256`` fail.

``write_text_lf`` writes *bytes* after normalising line endings to LF, so no
OS-level newline translation can reintroduce ``\\r``. This is the single
choke-point all bundle writers route through.

    The content is written to a temporary file in the same directory and then
    ``os.replace``\\ d into place, so a reader that already has ``path`` open keeps
    reading the original (now-unlinked) inode intact instead of seeing a truncated
    file. This matters for ``commands.sh``: an in-place ``--resume`` replay re-invokes
    the wrapper, which regenerates the very script bash is executing — a plain
    truncate-and-rewrite corrupts bash's read mid-run. The existing file's permission
    bits are preserved. Returns the written path.
